                    <p class="tips-left-text">Yes, they do. Although movies and other media often show cats drinking a bowl of milk, it’s not good for most felines.<br>

                    Water, however, is as vital to a cat’s survival as it is to that of humans. 60-70% of their body weight is water. Despite being good for them, many cats don’t like drinking water, especially if it’s still or standing water. This dislike for water can lead to a dehydrated cat, so it’s important to monitor your cat’s water intake. 
                    Why is Proper Hydration Important for Cats?<br>

                    Hydration is the physiological state of balanced electrolytes, specific minerals and fluids within the body, and maintaining this balance is important. Water is vital because it affects everything from organ function and nutrient transportation to circulation and digestion.<br>

                    It also helps decrease the likelihood of urinary stones and helps the kidneys flush out toxins.<br>  

                    All cats are different and have their own preferences, though. As a result, you may need to try a few different methods of providing water to find something your kitty likes.<br>  

                    What Causes Dehydration in Cats?<br>

                    Cats can become dehydrated for a number of reasons. One of the primary reasons is it’s in their genes. Felines evolved from desert dwellers, and therefore have a low thirst drive and can survive on less water than their canine counterparts.<br>

                    <p>
                    Cats have near-sightedness issues, so it may be hard for cats to visualize the edge of the water in a bowl. Additionally, when cats lap water from a bowl, they curve their tongue into a J-shape and bite off a column of water, which is incredibly inefficient. Cats only end up with 3/100 of a teaspoon per lap!*<br> 

                    Plus, cats are sensitive to the taste and presentation of water. Most cats instinctively gravitate toward fresh, moving water.<br>  

                    Conditions that make cats more prone to dehydration include chronic kidney disease and other conditions, such as diarrhea or diabetes. <br>

                    If your cat neglects her water bowl, she may become dehydrated. Signs of a dehydrated cat include:<br>
